            Junction Dance Company is a diverse group of talented individuals
            that came together to unite all styles of dance. Passionately driven
            to spread the love for the art of dance by performing at charity
            events, benefit concerts, parades, and competitions. We strive to
            create unity in the dance community and by connecting others who
            have yet to experience the same passion.
